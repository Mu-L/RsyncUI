The development commenced in December 2020 and RsyncUI version 1.0.0 will be relased in May 2021. RsyncUI is build for **macOS Big Sur** and later only. The name of the next version is **RsyncUI**, and because it is built for macOS Big Sur and later it will be released as a new application and not replace the current version of RsyncOSX.

A new [site for documentation](https://rsyncui.netlify.app) is in development.

## Dependencies

The application is implemented in pure SwiftUI and Swift. There are though three source code dependencies:

- check for TCP connectivity by utilizing [SwiftSocket](https://github.com/swiftsocket/SwiftSocket), some functions require connections to remote servers
- execute pre and post shellscripts by utilizing John Sundell´s [ShellOut](https://github.com/JohnSundell/ShellOut)
- utilizing John Sundell´s [Files](https://github.com/JohnSundell/Files) for reading files and catalogs

All three are available as source code and automatically included as part of building RsyncOSX.

## Tools used

The following tools are used in development:

- Xcode 12 (the main tool)
- make to compile new versions in terminal
- [create-dmg](https://github.com/sindresorhus/create-dmg) to create new releases
- [periphery](https://github.com/peripheryapp/periphery) to identify unused code
- [SwiftLint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint) to enforce Swift style and conventions
- [SwiftFormat](https://github.com/nicklockwood/SwiftFormat) for reformatting Swift code

All the above tools, except Xcode are installed by using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

## Localization

RsyncUI is localized to:

- English - the base language of RsyncOSX
- German - by [Andre Voigtmann](https://github.com/andre68723)
- Italian - by [Stefano Steve Cutelle'](https://github.com/stefanocutelle)
- Norwegian - by me

Localization is done by utilizing [Crowdin](https://rsyncosx.crowdin.com/u/projects/30) to translate the xliff files which are imported into Xcode after translating. Xcode then creates the required language strings. [Crowdin is free for open source projects](https://crowdin.com/page/open-source-project-setup-request).

## Signing and notarizing

The app is signed with my Apple ID developer certificate and [notarized](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202491) by Apple. See [signing and notarizing](https://rsyncui.netlify.app/post/notarized/) for info. Signing and notarizing is required to run on macOS Big Sur.

## Version of rsync

RsyncUI is verified with rsync versions 2.6.9, 3.1.2, 3.1.3 and 3.2.x. Other versions of rsync will work but numbers about transferred files is not set in logs. It is recommended to [install](https://rsyncui.netlify.app/post/rsync/) the latest version of rsync.
