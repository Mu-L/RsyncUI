## Dependencies

RsyncUI is implemented by utilizing the SwiftUI and Combine declarative frameworks, and Swift 5.5. There are though three source code dependencies:

- check for TCP connectivity by utilizing [SwiftSocket](https://github.com/swiftsocket/SwiftSocket), some functions require connections to remote servers
- execute pre and post shell scripts by utilizing John Sundell´s [ShellOut](https://github.com/JohnSundell/ShellOut)
- utilizing John Sundell´s [Files](https://github.com/JohnSundell/Files) for reading files and catalogs

All three are available as source code and automatically included as part of building RsyncOSX. There are also a couple of other sources from GitHub included as source code. Two of those are:

- [ActivityIndicatorView](https://github.com/exyte/ActivityIndicatorView) - RsyncUI is using RotatingDotsIndicatorView
- [AlertToast](https://github.com/elai950/AlertToast) - a better looking Alert for simple messages to the user

When RsyncUI is throwing an error, it is presented as a SwiftUI Alert.

## Tools used

The following tools are used in development:

- Xcode 13, the main tool, Swift 5.5 and SwiftUI 3
  - a few SwiftUI features in code require macOS Monterey (macOS 12)
- make to compile new versions in terminal
- [create-dmg](https://github.com/sindresorhus/create-dmg) to create new releases
- [SwiftLint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint) to enforce Swift style and conventions
- [SwiftFormat](https://github.com/nicklockwood/SwiftFormat) for reformatting Swift code
- [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) for git and GitHub

All the above tools, except Xcode and GitHub Desktop are installed by using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

## Localization

RsyncUI is localized to:

- English - the base language of RsyncOSX
- German - by [Andre Voigtmann](https://github.com/andre68723)
- Norwegian - by me

Localization is done by utilizing [Crowdin](https://rsyncosx.crowdin.com/u/projects/30) to translate the xliff files which are imported into Xcode after translating. Xcode then creates the required language strings. [Crowdin is free for open source projects](https://crowdin.com/page/open-source-project-setup-request).

## Signing and notarizing

The app is signed with my Apple ID developer certificate and [notarized](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202491) by Apple. See [signing and notarizing](https://rsyncui.netlify.app/post/notarized/) for info. Signing and notarizing is required to run on macOS Big Sur.

## Version of rsync

RsyncUI is verified with rsync versions 2.6.9, 3.1.2, 3.1.3 and 3.2.x. Other versions of rsync will work but numbers about transferred files is not set in logs. It is recommended to [install](https://rsyncui.netlify.app/post/rsync/) the latest version of rsync.
